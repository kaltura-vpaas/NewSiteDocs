# Kaltura Simulive API

Kaltura offers the ability to stream pre-recorded video via the actual Kaltura live stream infrastructure. Here is a diagram illustrating the structure of a kaltura simulive event:

Please refer to this [Kaltura simulive API example](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/kaltura-webcaster-simulive-php) for a working demo. **Please note: your account will need to be provisioned for livestreaming** 

This [guide](https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/creating-a-live-linear-stream-simulive-from-a-playlist-of-recorded-videos) will also give you some more context in setting up a live stream without an API. 

It is also possible to use other Kaltura video on demand entries before and after the simulive stream plays:
